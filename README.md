#### Brief Description of Project - 
As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace across all industries around the world, the
hospitality industry is starting to reap the benefits. Hotel management software has come a long way
in assisting hoteliers in improving the way their businesses operate, and its transformative impact is
undeniable.
The project, Hotel Management System is a web-based application that allows the hotel manager to
handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage banquet hall and rooms
booking make this system very flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and
does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives
him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system.
Hotel management project provides Room Booking, Customer Management, and Food Management,
Financial Management, Employee Management, and other necessary hotel management features.
Customers can view and book rooms online. Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving
the customerâ€™s booking request and other hotel services can also be viewed by the customers and can
book them too. The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the
hotel activities.
